A colour scheme for terminals, vim and friends.

This is **v2.0** - vastly improved, with more tweak, less cruft.

Falcon is a work horse of a colour scheme that will (hopefully) stand the test of time - with fewer gimmicks, a more restrained colour palette but with a splash just enough to distinguish everything semantically as well a touch of delight thrown in.
